# Host-Provisioning-Services
Virtual Disks deployment platform in local hardware with VHDx.

Create and deploy vDisks with VHDx and Windows Native Boot, clients will download and locally mount the vDisk working with the local hardware as if the operating system was locally installed. You can centrally update your vDisks and clients will be updated too. No more deploying Windows updates with WSUS or installing new software.

Check out the [documentation page](https://doc.gorgosystems.com) for details of how to start deploying.
